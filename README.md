# Heroes Of Pymoli Data Analysis

## Background 

I was tasked with analyzing the data for Heroes of Pymoli, it is the most recent fantasy game of a gaming company. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like me to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
